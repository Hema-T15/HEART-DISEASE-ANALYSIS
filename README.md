# HEART-DISEASE-ANALYSIS
This analysis helps highlight the power of Python in deriving insights from healthcare data and supports better understanding of heart disease indicators.
This project involves analyzing a heart disease dataset using core Python libraries to uncover meaningful patterns and insights. Using Pandas for data handling and Matplotlib/Seaborn for data visualization, I performed thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand how various factors such as age, gender, cholesterol levels, chest pain types, and blood pressure relate to heart disease.

Key findings were visualized through histograms, box plots, heatmaps, and correlation matrices, allowing clear interpretation of trends and risk factors. The project emphasized data cleaning, handling missing values, and interpreting relationships between features.
TOOLS : Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
